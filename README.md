# Crypto-price-prediction

This repo is for an ongoing project where I am exploring the use of machine learning to predict the closing price of Bitcoin. Python library, H2O AutoML was used. https://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/automl.html 

This is an ongoing project and the code will be posted soon. I am currently looking to source more data for this project.
